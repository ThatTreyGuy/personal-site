        <h3>Jerzees Sports Bar: 2017-2019</h3>
        <p>I began working as a bouncer at Jerzees Sports Bar in Athens, GA in November of my junior year. After months of hard work and deication, I began barbacking in June. Barbacking has taught me a lot about marketing, quick thinking, and problem solving. The experiences I have gained working at Jerzees and the relationships I have made over time are invaluable in shaping who I am as a person today.</p>

        <h3>High School Drum Instructor: 2015-2017</h3>
        <p>Beginning the summer after I graduated high school in 2015, I began teaching high school drumlines. My first year, a friend asked me to help him teach Ridgeland High School's band camp. That group went on to win the highest drum score at their final competition of that season. I ended up marching my final year of Redcoats at the University of Georgia with one of these students on the snare line. The next two summers I spent teaching my alma mater, Heritage High School. During both of these seasons, the group went on to win high drums at several competitions. Writing music and teaching band camps taught me a lot about preparation, dependability, and hard work.</p>

        <h3>Private Drum Lessons: 2014-2016</h3>
        <p>I began giving private drum set lessons during the summer going into my senior year of high school. I only had a couple of students, and I would go to their houses to give one hour lessons. Eventually, I began teaching drum lessons at an after-school art camp ran by a friend's mother. Here, I grew my base and taught upwards of 15-20 students in a single day. I also branched out to teach concert and marching percussion besides just drum set. Teaching private drum lessons has taught me about preparation, networking, and motivation.</p>
